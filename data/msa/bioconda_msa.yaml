description: The 'msa' package provides a unified R/Bioconductor interface to the
  multiple sequence alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega, and Muscle. All three
  algorithms are integrated in the package, therefore, they do not depend on any external
  software tools and are available for all major platforms. The multiple sequence
  alignment algorithms are complemented by a function for pretty-printing multiple
  sequence alignments using the LaTeX package TeXshade.
