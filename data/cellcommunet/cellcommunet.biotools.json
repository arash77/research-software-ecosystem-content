                "abstract": "Cell−cell communication, as a basic feature of multicellular organisms, is crucial for maintaining the biological functions and microenvironmental homeostasis of cells, organs, and whole organisms. Alterations in cell−cell communication contribute to many diseases, including cancers. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful method for studying cell−cell communication by enabling the analysis of ligand−receptor interactions. Here, we introduce CellCommuNet (http://www.inbirg.com/cellcommunet/), a comprehensive data resource for exploring cell−cell communication networks in scRNA-seq data from human and mouse tissues in normal and disease states. CellCommuNet currently includes 376 single datasets from multiple sources, and 118 comparison datasets between disease and normal samples originating from the same study. CellCommuNet provides information on the strength of communication between cells and related signalling pathways and facilitates the exploration of differences in cell−cell communication between healthy and disease states. Users can also search for specific signalling pathways, ligand−receptor pairs, and cell types of interest. CellCommuNet provides interactive graphics illustrating cell−cell communication in different states, enabling differential analysis of communication strength between disease and control samples. This comprehensive database aims to be a valuable resource for biologists studying cell−cell communication networks.",
