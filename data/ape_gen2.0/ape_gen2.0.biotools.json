                "abstract": "The recognition of peptides bound to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) receptors by T-cell receptors (TCRs) is a determinant of triggering the adaptive immune response. While the exact molecular features that drive the TCR recognition are still unknown, studies have suggested that the geometry of the joint peptide-MHC (pMHC) structure plays an important role. As such, there is a definite need for methods and tools that accurately predict the structure of the peptide bound to the MHC-I receptor. In the past few years, many pMHC structural modeling tools have emerged that provide high-quality modeled structures in the general case. However, there are numerous instances of non-canonical cases in the immunopeptidome that the majority of pMHC modeling tools do not attend to, most notably, peptides that exhibit non-standard amino acids and post-translational modifications (PTMs) or peptides that assume non-canonical geometries in the MHC binding cleft. Such chemical and structural properties have been shown to be present in neoantigens; therefore, accurate structural modeling of these instances can be vital for cancer immunotherapy. To this end, we have developed APE-Gen2.0, a tool that improves upon its predecessor and other pMHC modeling tools, both in terms of modeling accuracy and the available modeling range of non-canonical peptide cases. Some of the improvements include (i) the ability to model peptides that have different types of PTMs such as phosphorylation, nitration, and citrullination; (ii) a new and improved anchor identification routine in order to identify and model peptides that exhibit a non-canonical anchor conformation; and (iii) a web server that provides a platform for easy and accessible pMHC modeling. We further show that structures predicted by APE-Gen2.0 can be used to assess the effects that PTMs have in binding affinity in a more accurate manner than just using solely the sequence of the peptide. APE-Gen2.0 is freely available at https://apegen.kavrakilab.org.",
