description: This package provides a framework and complete preset pipeline for quantification
  and analysis of ATAC-seq Reads. It covers raw sequencing reads preprocessing (FASTQ
  files), reads alignment (Rbowtie2), aligned reads file operations (SAM, BAM, and
  BED files), peak calling (F-seq), genome annotations (Motif, GO, SNP analysis) and
  quality control report. The package is managed by dataflow graph. It is easy for
  user to pass variables seamlessly between processes and understand the workflow.
  Users can process FASTQ files through end-to-end preset pipeline which produces
  a pretty HTML report for quality control and preliminary statistical results, or
  customize workflow starting from any intermediate stages with esATAC functions easily
  and flexibly.
