                "abstract": "Motivation: Promoters with desirable properties are crucial in biotechnological applications. Generative AI (GenAI) has demonstrated potential in creating novel synthetic promoters with significantly enhanced functionality. However, these methods' reliance on various programming frameworks and specific task-oriented contexts limits their flexibilities. Overcoming these limitations is essential for researchers to fully leverage the power of GenAI to design promoters for their tasks. Results: Here, we introduce GPro (Generative AI-empowered toolkit for promoter design), a user-friendly toolkit that integrates a collection of cutting-edge GenAI-empowered approaches for promoter design. This toolkit provides a standardized pipeline covering essential promoter design processes, including training, optimization, and evaluation. Several detailed demos are provided to reproduce state-of-the-art promoter design pipelines. GPro's user-friendly interface makes it accessible to a wide range of users including non-AI experts. It also offers a variety of optional algorithms for each design process, and gives users the flexibility to compare methods and create customized pipelines.",
