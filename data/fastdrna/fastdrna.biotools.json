                "abstract": "Motivation: Direct RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) has revolutionized transcript mapping by offering enhanced precision due to its long-read length. Unlike traditional techniques, dRNA-seq eliminates the need for PCR amplification, reducing the impact of GC bias, and preserving valuable base physical information, such as RNA modification and poly(A) length estimation. However, the rapid advancement of ONT devices has set higher standards for analytical software, resulting in potential challenges of software incompatibility and reduced efficiency. Results: We present a novel workflow, called FASTdRNA, to manipulate dRNA-seq data efficiently. This workflow comprises two modules: A data preprocessing module and a data analysis module. The preprocessing data module, dRNAmain, encompasses basecalling, mapping, and transcript counting, which are essential for subsequent analyses. The data analysis module consists of a range of downstream analyses that facilitate the estimation of poly(A) length, prediction of RNA modifications, and assessment of alternative splicing events across different conditions with duplication. The FASTdRNA workflow is designed for the Snakemake framework and can be efficiently executed locally or in the cloud. Comparative experiments have demonstrated its superior performance compared to previous methods. This innovative workflow enhances the research capabilities of dRNA-seq data analysis pipelines by optimizing existing processes and expanding the scope of analysis.",
