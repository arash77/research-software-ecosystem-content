                "abstract": "The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.",
