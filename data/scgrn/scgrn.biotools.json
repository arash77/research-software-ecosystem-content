                "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are interpretable graph models encompassing the regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes. Making sense of the topology and dynamics of GRNs is fundamental to interpreting the mechanisms of disease etiology and translating corresponding findings into novel therapies. Recent advances in single-cell multi-omics techniques have prompted the computational inference of GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data at an unprecedented resolution. Here, we present scGRN (https://bio.liclab.net/scGRN/), a comprehensive single-cell multi-omics gene regulatory network platform of human and mouse. The current version of scGRN catalogs 237 051 cell type-specific GRNs (62 999 692 TF–target gene pairs), covering 160 tissues/cell lines and 1324 single-cell samples. scGRN is the first resource documenting large-scale cell type-specific GRN information of diverse human and mouse conditions inferred from single-cell multi-omics data. We have implemented multiple online tools for effective GRN analysis, including differential TF–target network analysis, TF enrichment analysis, and pathway downstream analysis. We also provided details about TF binding to promoters, super-enhancers and typical enhancers of target genes in GRNs. Taken together, scGRN is an integrative and useful platform for searching, browsing, analyzing, visualizing and downloading GRNs of interest, enabling insight into the differences in regulatory mechanisms across diverse conditions.",
