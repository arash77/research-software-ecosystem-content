                "abstract": "Background: Uncovering functional genetic variants from an allele-specific perspective is of paramount importance in advancing our understanding of gene regulation and genetic diseases. Recently, various allele-specific events, such as allele-specific gene expression, allele-specific methylation, and allele-specific binding, have been explored on a genome-wide scale due to the development of high-throughput sequencing methods. RNA secondary structure, which plays a crucial role in multiple RNA-associated processes like RNA modification, translation and splicing, has emerged as an essential focus of relevant research. However, tools to identify genetic variants associated with allele-specific RNA secondary structures are still lacking. Results: Here, we develop a computational tool called ‘AStruct’ that enables us to detect allele-specific RNA secondary structure (ASRS) from RT-stop based structuromic probing data. AStruct shows robust performance in both simulated datasets and public icSHAPE datasets. We reveal that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with higher AStruct scores are enriched in coding regions and tend to be functional. These SNPs are highly conservative, have the potential to disrupt sites involved in m6A modification or protein binding, and are frequently associated with disease. Conclusions: AStruct is a tool dedicated to invoke allele-specific RNA secondary structure events at heterozygous SNPs in RT-stop based structuromic probing data. It utilizes allelic variants, base pairing and RT-stop information under different cell conditions to detect dynamic and functional ASRS. Compared to sequence-based tools, AStruct considers dynamic cell conditions and outperforms in detecting functional variants. AStruct is implemented in JAVA and is freely accessible at: https://github.com/canceromics/AStruct.",
