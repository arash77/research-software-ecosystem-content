                "abstract": "Motivation: Presenting the integrated results of bioinformatics research can be challenging and requires sophisticated visualization components, which can be time-consuming to develop. This article presents a new way to effectively communicate research findings. Results: We have developed a static web page generator, JSONWP, which is specifically designed for protein bioinformatics research. Utilizing React (a JavaScript library used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web applications), we have integrated publicly available bioinformatics visualization components to provide standardized access to these components. JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight textual data format often used to structure and exchange information between different software tools.) is used as the input source due to its ability to represent nearly all types of data using key and value pairs. This allows researchers to use their preferred programming language to create a JSON representation, which can then be converted into a website by JSONWP. No server or domain is required to host the website, as only the publicly accessible JSON file is required. Conclusions: Overall, JSONWP provides a useful new tool for bioinformatics researchers to effectively communicate their findings. The open-source implementation is located at https://github.com/MesihK/react-json-wpbuilder, and the tool can be used at jsonwp.onrender.com.",
