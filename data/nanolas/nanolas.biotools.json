                "abstract": "Nanobodies, a unique subclass of antibodies first discovered in camelid animals, are composed solely of a single heavy chain's variable region. Their significantly reduced molecular weight, in comparison to conventional antibodies, confers numerous advantages in the treatment of various diseases. As research and applications involving nanobodies expand, the quantity of identified nanobodies is also rapidly growing. However, the existing antibody databases are deficient in type and coverage, failing to satisfy the comprehensive needs of researchers and thus impeding progress in nanobody research. In response to this, we have amalgamated data from multiple sources to successfully assemble a new and comprehensive nanobody database. This database has currently included the latest nanobody data and provides researchers with an excellent search and data display interface, thus facilitating the progression of nanobody research and their application in disease treatment. In summary, the newly constructed Nanobody Library and Archive System may significantly enhance the retrieval efficiency and application potential of nanobodies. We envision that Nanobody Library and Archive System will serve as an accessible, robust and efficient tool for nanobody research and development, propelling advancements in the field of biomedicine.
