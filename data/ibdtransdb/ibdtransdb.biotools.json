                "abstract": "Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) therapies are ineffective in at least 40% patients, and transcriptomic datasets have been widely used to reveal the pathogenesis and to identify the novel drug targets for these patients. Although public IBD transcriptomic datasets are available from many web-based tools/databases, due to the unstructured metadata and data description of these public datasets, most of these tools/databases do not allow querying datasets based on multiple keywords (e.g. colon and infliximab). Furthermore, few tools/databases can compare and integrate the datasets from the query results. To fill these gaps, we have developed IBDTransDB (https://abbviegrc.shinyapps.io/ibdtransdb/), a manually curated transcriptomic database for IBD. IBDTransDB includes a manually curated database with 34 transcriptomic datasets (2932 samples, 122 differential comparisons) and a query system supporting 35 keywords from 5 attributes (e.g. tissue and treatment). IBDTransDB also provides three modules for data analyses and integration. IBDExplore allows interactive visualization of differential gene list, pathway enrichment, gene signature and cell deconvolution analyses from a single dataset. IBDCompare supports comparisons of selected genes or pathways from multiple datasets across different conditions. IBDIntegrate performs meta-analysis to prioritize a list of genes/pathways based on user-selected datasets and conditions. Using two case studies related to infliximab treatment, we demonstrated that IBDTransDB provides a unique platform for biologists and clinicians to reveal IBD pathogenesis and identify the novel targets by integrating with other omics data.",
