                "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary treatment modalities of cancer, with 40-60% of cancer patients benefiting from RT during their treatment course. The intrinsic radiosensitivity or acquired radioresistance of tumor cells would affect the response to RT and clinical outcomes in patients. Thus, mining the regulatory mechanisms in tumor radiosensitivity or radioresistance that ha v e been v erified b y biological e xperiments and computational analysis methods will enhance the o v erall understanding of RT. Here, we describe a comprehensive database dbCRAF ( http: // dbCRAF.xialab.info/ ) to document and annotate the factors (1,677 genes, 49 proteins and 612 radiosensitizers) linked with radiation response, including radiosensitivit y, radioresist ance in cancer cells and prognosis in cancer patients receiving RT. On the one hand, dbCRAF enables researchers to directly access kno wledge f or regulation of radiation response in human cancer buried in the vast literature. On the other hand, dbCRAF pro vides f our fle xible modules to analyz e and visualiz e the functional relationship betw een these f actors and clinical outcome, KEGG pathw a y and target genes. In conclusion, dbCRAF serves as a valuable resource for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of radiation response in human cancers as well as for the improvement of RT options.",
