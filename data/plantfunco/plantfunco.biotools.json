                "abstract": "Evolutionary epigenomics and, more generally, evolutionary functional genomics, are emerging fields that study how non-DNA-encoded alterations in gene expression regulation are an important form of plasticity and adaptation. Previous evidence analyzing plants? comparative functional genomics has mostly focused on comparing same assay-matched experiments, missing the power of heterogeneous datasets for conservation inference. To fill this gap, we developed PlantFUN(ctional)CO(nservation) database, which is constituted by several tools and two main resources: interspecies chromatin states and functional genomics conservation scores, presented and analyzed in this work for three well-established plant models (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays). Overall, PlantFUNCO elucidated evolutionary information in terms of cross-species functional agreement. Therefore, providing a new complementary comparative-genomics source for assessing evolutionary studies. To illustrate the potential applications of this database, we replicated two previously published models predicting genetic redundancy in A. thaliana and found that chromatin states are a determinant of paralogs degree of functional divergence. These predictions were validated based on the phenotypes of mitochondrial alternative oxidase knockout mutants under two different stressors. Taking all the above into account, PlantFUNCO aim to leverage data diversity and extrapolate molecular mechanisms findings from different model organisms to determine the extent of functional conservation, thus, deepening our understanding of how plants epigenome and functional noncoding genome have evolved.
