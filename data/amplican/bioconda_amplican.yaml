description: '`amplican` performs alignment of the amplicon reads, normalizes gathered
  data, calculates multiple statistics (e.g. cut rates, frameshifts) and presents
  results in form of aggregated reports. Data and statistics can be broken down by
  experiments, barcodes, user defined groups, guides and amplicons allowing for quick
  identification of potential problems.'
