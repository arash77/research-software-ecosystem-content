                "abstract": "Identifying unknown functional properties of proteins is essential for understanding their roles in both health and disease states. The domain composition of a protein can reveal critical information in this context, as domains are structural and functional units that dictate how the protein should act at the molecular level. The expensive and time-consuming nature of wet-lab experimental approaches prompted researchers to develop computational strategies for predicting the functions of proteins. In this study, we proposed a new method called Domain2GO that infers associations between protein domains and function-defining gene ontology (GO) terms, thus redefining the problem as domain function prediction. Domain2GO uses documented protein-level GO annotations together with proteins' domain annotations. Co-annotation patterns of domains and GO terms in the same proteins are examined using statistical resampling to obtain reliable associations. As a use-case study, we evaluated the biological relevance of examples selected from the Domain2GO-generated domain-GO term mappings via literature review. Then, we applied Domain2GO to predict unknown protein functions by propagating domain-associated GO terms to proteins annotated with these domains. For function prediction performance evaluation and comparison against other methods, we employed Critical Assessment of Function Annotation 3 (CAFA3) challenge datasets. The results demonstrated the high potential of Domain2GO, particularly for predicting molecular function and biological process terms, along with advantages such as producing interpretable results and having an exceptionally low computational cost. The approach presented here can be extended to other ontologies and biological entities to investigate unknown relationships in complex and large-scale biological data. The source code, datasets, results, and user instructions for Domain2GO are available at https://github.com/HUBioDataLab/Domain2GO. Additionally, we offer a user-friendly online tool at https://huggingface.co/spaces/HUBioDataLab/Domain2GO, which simplifies the prediction of functions of previously unannotated proteins solely using amino acid sequences.",
