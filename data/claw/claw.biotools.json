                "abstract": "Chloroplasts are photosynthetic organelles in algal and plant cells that contain their own genome. Chloroplast genomes are commonly used in evolutionary studies and taxonomic identification and are increasingly becoming a target for crop improvement studies. As DNA sequencing becomes more affordable, researchers are collecting vast swathes of high-quality whole-genome sequence data from laboratory and field settings alike. Whole tissue read libraries sequenced with the primary goal of understanding the nuclear genome will inadvertently contain many reads derived from the chloroplast genome. These whole-genome, whole-tissue read libraries can additionally be used to assemble chloroplast genomes with little to no extra cost. While several tools exist that make use of short-read second generation and third-generation long-read sequencing data for chloroplast genome assembly, these tools may have complex installation steps, inadequate error reporting, poor expandability, and/or lack scalability. Here, we present CLAW (Chloroplast Long-read Assembly Workflow), an easy to install, customise, and use Snakemake tool to assemble chloroplast genomes from chloroplast long-reads found in whole-genome read libraries (https://github.com/aaronphillips7493/CLAW). Using 19 publicly available reference chloroplast genome assemblies and long-read libraries from algal, monocot and eudicot species, we show that CLAW can rapidly produce chloroplast genome assemblies with high similarity to the reference assemblies. CLAW was designed such that users have complete control over parameterisation, allowing individuals to optimise CLAW to their specific use cases. We expect that CLAW will provide researchers (with varying levels of bioinformatics expertise) with an additional resource useful for contributing to the growing number of publicly available chloroplast genome assemblies.",
