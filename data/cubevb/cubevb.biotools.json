                "abstract": "In this article, we study the distance matrix as a representation of a phylogeny by way of hierarchical clustering. By defining a multivariate normal distribution on (a subset of) the entries in a matrix, this allows us to represent a distribution over rooted time trees. Here, we demonstrate tree distributions can be represented accurately this way for a number of published tree distributions. Though such a representation does not map to unique trees, restriction to a subspace, in particular one we call a ‘‘cube’’, makes the representation bijective at the cost of not being able to represent all possible trees. We introduce an algorithm ‘‘cubeVB’’ specifically for cubes and show through well calibrated simulation study that it is possible to recover parameters of interest like tree height and length. Although a cube cannot represent all of tree space, it is a great improvement over a single summary tree, and it opens up exciting new opportunities for scaling up Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We also demonstrate how to use a matrix representation of a tree distribution to get better summary trees than commonly used maximum clade credibility trees. An open source implementation of the cubeVB algorithm is available from https://github.com/rbouckaert/cubevb as the cubevb package for BEAST 2.",
