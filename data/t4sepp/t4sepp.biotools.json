                "abstract": "Many pathogenic bacteria use type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) to deliver effectors (T4SEs) into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, causing diseases. The identification of effectors is a crucial step in understanding the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity, but this remains a major challenge. In this study, we used the full-length embedding features generated by six pre-trained protein language models to train classifiers predicting T4SEs and compared their performance. We integrated three modules into a model called T4SEpp. The first module searched for full-length homologs of known T4SEs, signal sequences, and effector domains; the second module fine-tuned a machine learning model using data for a signal sequence feature; and the third module used the three best-performing pre-trained protein language models. T4SEpp outperformed other state-of-the-art (SOTA) software tools, achieving ∼0.98 accuracy at a high specificity of ∼0.99, based on the assessment of an independent validation dataset. T4SEpp predicted 13 T4SEs from Helicobacter pylori, including the well-known CagA and 12 other potential ones, among which eleven could potentially interact with human proteins. This suggests that these potential T4SEs may be associated with the pathogenicity of H. pylori. Overall, T4SEpp provides a better solution to assist in the identification of bacterial T4SEs and facilitates studies of bacterial pathogenicity.
