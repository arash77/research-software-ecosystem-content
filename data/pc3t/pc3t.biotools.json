                "abstract": "Cellular transitions hold great promise in translational medicine research. However, therapeutic applications are limited by the low efficiency and safety concerns of using transcription factors. Small molecules provide a temporal and highly tunable approach to overcome these issues. Here, we present PC3T, a computational framework to enrich molecules that induce desired cellular transitions, and PC3T was able to consistently enrich small molecules that had been experimentally validated in both bulk and single-cell datasets. We then predicted small molecule reprogramming of fibroblasts into hepatic progenitor-like cells (HPLCs). The converted cells exhibited epithelial cell-like morphology and HPLC-like gene expression pattern. Hepatic functions were also observed, such as glycogen storage and lipid accumulation. Finally, we collected and manually curated a cell state transition resource containing 224 time-course gene expression datasets and 153 cell types. Our framework, together with the data resource, is freely available at http://pc3t.idrug.net.cn/ . We believe that PC3T is a powerful tool to promote chemical-induced cell state transitions.",
