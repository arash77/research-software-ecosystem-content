                "abstract": "Reproducible functional assays to study in vitro neuronal networks represent an important cornerstone in the quest to develop physiologically relevant cellular models of human diseases. Here, we introduce DeePhys, a MATLAB-based analysis tool for data-driven functional phenotyping of in vitro neuronal cultures recorded by high-density microelectrode arrays. DeePhys is a modular workflow that offers a range of techniques to extract features from spike-sorted data, allowing for the examination of functional phenotypes both at the individual cell and network levels, as well as across development. In addition, DeePhys incorporates the capability to integrate novel features and to use machine-learning-assisted approaches, which facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of pharmacological interventions. To illustrate its practical application, we apply DeePhys to human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived dopaminergic neurons obtained from both patients and healthy individuals and showcase how DeePhys enables phenotypic screenings.",
