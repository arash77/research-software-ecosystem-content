description: This Rcpp-based package implements a highly efficient data structure
  and algorithm for performing alignment of short reads from CRISPR or shRNA screens
  to reference barcode library. Sequencing error are considered and matching qualities
  are evaluated based on Phred scores. A Bayes' classifier is employed to predict
  the originating barcode of a read. The package supports provision of user-defined
  probability models for evaluating matching qualities. The package also supports
  multi-threading.
