                "abstract": "Recent studies have shed light on the potential of circular RNA (circRNA) as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and as a nucleic acid vaccine. The exploration of these functionalities requires correct circRNA full-length sequences; however, existing assembly tools can only correctly assemble some circRNAs, and their performance can be further improved. Here, we introduce a novel feature known as the junction contig (JC), which is an extension of the back-splice junction (BSJ). Leveraging the strengths of both BSJ and JC, we present a novel method called JCcirc (https://github.com/cbbzhang/JCcirc). It enables efficient reconstruction of all types of circRNA full-length sequences and their alternative isoforms using splice graphs and fragment coverage. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of JCcirc over existing methods on human simulation datasets, and its average F1 score surpasses CircAST by 0.40 and outperforms both CIRI-full and circRNAfull by 0.13. For circRNAs below 400 bp, 400-800 bp, 800 bp-1200 bp and above 1200 bp, the correct assembly rates are 0.13, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03 higher, respectively, than those achieved by existing methods. Moreover, JCcirc also outperforms existing assembly tools on other five model species datasets and real sequencing datasets. These results show that JCcirc is a robust tool for accurately assembling circRNA full-length sequences, laying the foundation for the functional analysis of circRNAs.",
