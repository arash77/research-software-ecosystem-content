                "abstract": "In recent years, the FAIR guiding principles and the broader concept of open science has grown in importance in academic research, especially as funding entities have aggressively promoted public sharing of research products. Key to public research sharing is deposition of datasets into online data repositories, but it can be a chore to transform messy unstructured data into the forms required by these repositories. To help generate Metabolomics Workbench depositions, we have developed the MESSES (Metadata from Experimental SpreadSheets Extraction System) software package, implemented in the Python 3 programming language and supported on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. MESSES helps transform tabular data from multiple sources into a Metabolomics Workbench specific deposition format. The package provides three commands, extract, validate, and convert, that implement a natural data transformation workflow. Moreover, MESSES facilitates richer metadata capture than is typically attempted by manual efforts. The source code and extensive documentation is hosted on GitHub and is also available on the Python Package Index for easy installation.",
