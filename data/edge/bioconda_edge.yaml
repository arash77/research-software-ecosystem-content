description: The edge package implements methods for carrying out differential expression
  analyses of genome-wide gene expression studies. Significance testing using the
  optimal discovery procedure and generalized likelihood ratio tests (equivalent to
  F-tests and t-tests) are implemented for general study designs. Special functions
  are available to facilitate the analysis of common study designs, including time
  course experiments. Other packages such as snm, sva, and qvalue are integrated in
  edge to provide a wide range of tools for gene expression analysis.
