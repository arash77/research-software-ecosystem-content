                "abstract": "Integration of heterogeneous single-cell sequencing datasets generated across multiple tissue locations, time, and conditions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular states and expression programs underlying complex biological systems. Here, we present scDREAMER (https://github.com/Zafar-Lab/scDREAMER), a data-integration framework that employs deep generative models and adversarial training for both unsupervised and supervised (scDREAMER-Sup) integration of multiple batches. Using six real benchmarking datasets, we demonstrate that scDREAMER can overcome critical challenges including skewed cell type distribution among batches, nested batch-effects, large number of batches and conservation of development trajectory across batches. Our experiments also show that scDREAMER and scDREAMER-Sup outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised integration methods respectively in batch-correction and conservation of biological variation. Using a 1 million cells dataset, we demonstrate that scDREAMER is scalable and can perform atlas-level cross-species (e.g., human and mouse) integration while being faster than other deep-learning-based methods.",
