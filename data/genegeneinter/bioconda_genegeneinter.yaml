description: The aim of this package is to propose several methods for testing gene-gene
  interaction in case-control association studies. Such a test can be done by aggregating
  SNP-SNP interaction tests performed at the SNP level (SSI) or by using gene-gene
  multidimensionnal methods (GGI) methods. The package also proposes tools for a graphic
  display of the results. <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i12>.
