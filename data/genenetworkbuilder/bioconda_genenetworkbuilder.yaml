description: Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of transcription
  factors using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data.
  Inputting a list of genes of potential targets of one TF from ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq,
  and the gene expression results, GeneNetworkBuilder generates a regulatory network
  of the TF.
