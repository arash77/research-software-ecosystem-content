                "abstract": "Long non-coding-RNAs (lncRNAs) are an expanding set of cis-/trans-regulatory RNA genes that outnumber the protein-coding genes. Although being increasingly discovered, the functional role of the majority of lncRNAs in diverse biological conditions is undefined. Increasing evidence supports the critical role of lncRNAs in the emergence, regulation, and progression of various viral infections including influenza, hepatitis, coronavirus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Hence, the identification of signature lncRNAs would facilitate focused analysis of their functional roles accounting for their targets and regulatory mechanisms associated with infections. Towards this, we compiled 2803 lncRNAs identified to be modulated by 33 viral strains in various mammalian cell types and are provided through the resource named VirhostlncR (http://ciods.in/VirhostlncR/). The information on each of the viral strains, their multiplicity of infection, duration of infection, host cell name and cell types, fold change of lncRNA expression, and their specific identification methods are integrated into VirhostlncR. Based on the current datasets, we report 150 lncRNAs including differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA (DANCR), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), and plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) to be perturbed by two or more viruses. Analysis of viral protein interactions with human transcription factors (TFs) or TF-containing protein complexes identified that distinct viruses can transcriptionally regulate many of these lncRNAs through multiple protein complexes. Together, we believe that the current dataset will enable priority selection of lncRNAs for identification of their targets and serve as an effective platform for the analysis of noncoding RNA-mediated regulations in viral infections.",
