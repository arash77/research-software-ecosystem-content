                "abstract": "We herein introduce voyAGEr, an online graphical interface to explore age-related gene expression alterations in 49 human tissues. voyAGEr offers a visualisation and statistical toolkit for the finding and functional exploration of sex-and tissue-specific transcriptomic changes with age. In its conception, we developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline leveraging RNA sequencing data, from the GTEx project, encompassing more than 900 individuals. voyAGEr reveals transcriptomic signatures of the known asynchronous ageing between tissues, allowing the observation of tissue-specific age periods of major transcriptional changes, associated with alterations in different biological pathways, cellular composition, and disease conditions. Notably, voyAGEr was created to assist researchers with no expertise in bioinformatics, providing a supportive framework for elaborating, testing and refining their hypotheses on the molecular nature of human ageing and its association with pathologies, thereby also aiding in the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. voyAGEr is freely available at https://compbio.imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/app/voyAGEr.",
