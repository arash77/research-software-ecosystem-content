                "abstract": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encodes a range of immune response genes, including the human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in humans. These molecules bind peptide antigens and present them on the cell surface for T cell recognition. The repertoires of peptides presented by HLA molecules are termed immunopeptidomes. The highly polymorphic nature of the genres that encode the HLA molecules confers allotype-specific differences in the sequences of bound ligands. Allotype-specific ligand preferences are often defined by peptide-binding motifs. Individuals express up to six classical class I HLA allotypes, which likely present peptides displaying different binding motifs. Such complex datasets make the deconvolution of immunopeptidomic data into allotype-specific contributions and further dissection of binding-specificities challenging. Herein, we developed MHCpLogics as an interactive machine learning-based tool for mining peptide-binding sequence motifs and visualization of immunopeptidome data across complex datasets. We showcase the functionalities of MHCpLogics by analyzing both in-house and published mono- and multi-allelic immunopeptidomics data. The visualization modalities of MHCpLogics allow users to inspect clustered sequences down to individual peptide components and to examine broader sequence patterns within multiple immunopeptidome datasets. MHCpLogics can deconvolute large immunopeptidome datasets enabling the interrogation of clusters for the segregation of allotype-specific peptide sequence motifs, identification of sub-peptidome motifs, and the exportation of clustered peptide sequence lists. The tool facilitates rapid inspection of immunopeptidomes as a resource for the immunology and vaccine communities. MHCpLogics is a standalone application available via an executable installation at: https://github.com/PurcellLab/MHCpLogics.",
