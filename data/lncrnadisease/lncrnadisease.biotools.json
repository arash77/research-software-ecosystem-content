                "abstract": "Systematic integration of lncRNA-disease associations is of great importance for further understanding their underlying molecular mechanisms and exploring lncRNA-based biomarkers and therapeutics. The database of long non-coding RNA-associated diseases (LncRNADisease) is designed for the above purpose. Here, an updated version (LncRNADisease v3.0) has curated comprehensive lncRNA (including circRNA) and disease associations from the burgeoning literatures. LncRNADisease v3.0 exhibits an over 2-fold increase in experimentally supported associations, with a total of 25440 entries, compared to the last version. Besides, each lncRNA-disease pair is assigned a confidence score based on experimental evidence. Moreover, all associations between lncRNAs/circRNAs and diseases are classified into general associations and causal associations, representing whether lncRNAs or circRNAs can directly lead to the development or progression of corresponding diseases, with 15721 and 9719 entries, respectively. In a case study, we used the data of LncRNADisease v3.0 to calculate the phenotypic similarity between human and mouse lncRNAs. This database will continue to serve as a valuable resource for potential clinical applications related to lncRNAs and circRNAs. LncRNADisease v3.0 is freely available at http://www.rnanut.net/lncrnadisease.",
