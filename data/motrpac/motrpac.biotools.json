                "abstract": "Endurance exercise training is known to reduce risk for a range of complex diseases. However, the molecular basis of this effect has been challenging to study and largely restricted to analyses of either few or easily biopsied tissues. Extensive transcriptome data collected across 15 tissues during exercise training in rats as part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium has provided a unique opportunity to clarify how exercise can affect tissue-specific gene expression and further suggest how exercise adaptation may impact complex disease-associated genes. To build this map, we integrate this multi-tissue atlas of gene expression changes with gene-disease targets, genetic regulation of expression, and trait relationship data in humans. Consensus from multiple approaches prioritizes specific tissues and genes where endurance exercise impacts disease-relevant gene expression. Specifically, we identify a total of 5523 trait-tissue-gene triplets to serve as a valuable starting point for future investigations [Exercise; Transcription; Human Phenotypic Variation].",
