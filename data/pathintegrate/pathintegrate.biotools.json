                "abstract": "As terabytes of multi-omics data are being generated, there is an ever-increasing need for methods facilitating the integration and interpretation of such data. Current multi-omics integration methods typically output lists, clusters, or subnetworks of molecules related to an outcome. Even with expert domain knowledge, discerning the biological processes involved is a time-consuming activity. Here we propose PathIntegrate, a method for integrating multi-omics datasets based on pathways, designed to exploit knowledge of biological systems and thus provide interpretable models for such studies. PathIntegrate employs single-sample pathway analysis to transform multi-omics datasets from the molecular to the pathway-level, and applies a predictive single-view or multi-view model to integrate the data. Model outputs include multi-omics pathways ranked by their contribution to the outcome prediction, the contribution of each omics layer, and the importance of each molecule in a pathway. Using semi-synthetic data we demonstrate the benefit of grouping molecules into pathways to detect signals in low signal-to-noise scenarios, as well as the ability of PathIntegrate to precisely identify important pathways at low effect sizes. Finally, using COPD and COVID-19 data we showcase how PathIntegrate enables convenient integration and interpretation of complex high-dimensional multi-omics datasets. PathIntegrate is available as an open-source Python package.",
