                "abstract": "Intercellularcommunication significantly influences tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. An intercellular communication inference method includes two main procedures: ligand-receptor interaction (LRI) curation and LRI-mediated intercellular communication strength measurement. The construction of a comprehensive, high-confident and well-organized LRI database contributes to intercellular communication inference. Here, we developed a computational framework named CellDialog to reconstruct an intercellular connectivity network based on the combined expression of ligands and receptors involved in sender and receiver cells. CellDialog first captures high-confident LRIs through LRI feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Furthermore, CellDialog uses a three-point estimation approach to measure the LRI-mediated intercellular communication strength by combining LRI filtering and single-cell RNA sequencing data. A comparison analysis of CellDialog and the other tools was conducted, and it was found that CellDialog can efficiently decode intercellular communications. Additionally, CellDialog offers a heatmap view and network view for intercellular communication visualization. In summary, CellDialog provides a tool that allows researchers to analyze intercellular signal transduction.",
