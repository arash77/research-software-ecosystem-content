                "abstract": "Motivation: The human microbiome, found throughout various body parts, plays a crucial role in health dynamics and disease development. Recent research has highlighted microbiome disparities between patients with different diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting the microbiomeâ€™s potential in recognizing health states. Traditionally, microbiome-based status classification relies on pre-trained machine learning (ML) models. However, most ML methods overlook microbial relationships, limiting model performance. Results: To address this gap, we propose PM-CNN (Phylogenetic Multi-path Convolutional Neural Network), a novel phylogeny-based neural network model for multi-status classification and disease detection using microbiome data. PM-CNN organizes microbes based on their phylogenetic relationships and extracts features using a multi-path convolutional neural network. An ensemble learning method then fuses these features to make accurate classification decisions. We applied PM-CNN to human microbiome data for status and disease detection, demonstrating its significant superiority over existing ML models. These results provide a robust foundation for microbiome-based state recognition and disease prediction in future research and applications.",
