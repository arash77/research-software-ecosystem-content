    "description": "A computational framework to explore large-scale biosynthetic diversity.\n\nBiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) is a software package, written in Python, that constructs sequence similarity networks of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) and groups them into Gene Cluster Families (GCFs). BiG-SCAPE does this by rapidly calculating a distance matrix between gene clusters based on a comparison of their protein domain content, order, copy number and sequence identity.\n\nIt defines a distance metric between Gene Clusters using a combination of three indices (Jaccard Index of domain types, Domain Sequence Similarity the Adjacency...\n\nBiG-SCAPE and CORASON provide a set of tools to explore the diversity of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across large numbers of genomes, by constructing BGC sequence similarity networks, grouping BGCs into gene cluster families, and exploring gene cluster diversity linked to enzyme phylogenies.",

                "abstract": "Genome mining has become a key technology to exploit natural product diversity. Although initially performed on a single-genome basis, the process is now being scaled up to mine entire genera, strain collections and microbiomes. However, no bioinformatic framework is currently available for effectively analyzing datasets of this size and complexity. In the present study, a streamlined computational workflow is provided, consisting of two new software tools: the ‘biosynthetic gene similarity clustering and prospecting engine’ (BiG-SCAPE), which facilitates fast and interactive sequence similarity network analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters and gene cluster families; and the ‘core analysis of syntenic orthologues to prioritize natural product gene clusters’ (CORASON), which elucidates phylogenetic relationships within and across these families. BiG-SCAPE is validated by correlating its output to metabolomic data across 363 actinobacterial strains and the discovery potential of CORASON is demonstrated by comprehensively mapping biosynthetic diversity across a range of detoxin/rimosamide-related gene cluster families, culminating in the characterization of seven detoxin analogues.",
