description: martini deals with the low power inherent to GWAS studies by using prior
  knowledge represented as a network. SNPs are the vertices of the network, and the
  edges represent biological relationships between them (genomic adjacency, belonging
  to the same gene, physical interaction between protein products). The network is
  scanned using SConES, which looks for groups of SNPs maximally associated with the
  phenotype, that form a close subnetwork.
