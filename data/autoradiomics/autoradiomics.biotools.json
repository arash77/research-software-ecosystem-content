                "abstract": "Purpose: Machine learning based on radiomics features has seen huge success in a variety of clinical applications. However, the need for standardization and reproducibility has been increasingly recognized as a necessary step for future clinical translation. We developed a novel, intuitive open-source framework to facilitate all data analysis steps of a radiomics workflow in an easy and reproducible manner and evaluated it by reproducing classification results in eight available open-source datasets from different clinical entities. Methods: The framework performs image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, modeling, and model evaluation, and can automatically choose the optimal parameters for a given task. All analysis steps can be reproduced with a web application, which offers an interactive user interface and does not require programming skills. We evaluated our method in seven different clinical applications using eight public datasets: six datasets from the recently published WORC database, and two prostate MRI datasetsâ€”Prostate MRI and Ultrasound With Pathology and Coordinates of Tracked Biopsy (Prostate-UCLA) and PROSTATEx. Results: In the analyzed datasets, AutoRadiomics successfully created and optimized models using radiomics features. For WORC datasets, we achieved AUCs ranging from 0.56 for lung melanoma metastases detection to 0.93 for liposarcoma detection and thereby managed to replicate the previously reported results. No significant overfitting between training and test sets was observed. For the prostate cancer detection task, results were better in the PROSTATEx dataset (AUC = 0.73 for prostate and 0.72 for lesion mask) than in the Prostate-UCLA dataset (AUC 0.61 for prostate and 0.65 for lesion mask), with external validation results varying from AUC = 0.51 to AUC = 0.77. Conclusion: AutoRadiomics is a robust tool for radiomic studies, which can be used as a comprehensive solution, one of the analysis steps, or an exploratory tool. Its wide applicability was confirmed by the results obtained in the diverse analyzed datasets. The framework, as well as code for this analysis, are publicly available under https://github.com/pwoznicki/AutoRadiomics.",
