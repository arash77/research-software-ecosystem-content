    "description": "Precision analysis of small RNA-seq data with user-defined hierarchical selection rules. tinyRNA performs precision analysis of small RNAs, including miRNAs, piRNAs, and siRNAs, from high-throughput sequencing experiments. At the core of tinyRNA is a highly flexible counting utility, tiny-count, that allows for hierarchical assignment of small RNA reads to features based on positional information, extent of feature overlap, 5’ nucleotide, length, and strandedness. tinyRNA provides an all-in-one solution for small RNA-seq data analysis, with documentation and statistics generated at each step for accurate, reproducible results",

                "abstract": "Summary: tiny-count is a highly flexible counting tool that allows for hierarchical classification and quantification of small RNA reads from high-throughput sequencing data. Selection rules can be used to filter reads by 5′ nucleotide, length, position of alignments in relation to reference features, and by the number of mismatches to reference sequences. tiny-count can quantify reads aligned to a genome or directly to small RNA or transcript sequences. With tiny-count, users can quantify a single class of small RNAs or multiple classes in parallel. tiny-count can resolve distinct classes of small RNAs, for example, piRNAs and siRNAs, produced from the same locus. It can distinguish small RNA variants, such as miRNAs and isomiRs, with single-nucleotide precision. tRNA, rRNA, and other RNA fragments can also be quantified. tiny-count can be run alone or as part of tinyRNA, a workflow that provides a basic all-in-one command line-based solution for small RNA-seq data analysis, with documentation and statistics generated at each step for accurate and reproducible results.",
