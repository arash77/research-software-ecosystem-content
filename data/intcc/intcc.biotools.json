Users input a list of datasets, clustering methods, the number of clutsers for separate datasets and global, criterions and so on. Then consensus clustering will be applied to each dataset to derive consensus matrix.",

Integrative clustering has emerged as a powerful unsupervised learning framework for subtype discovery. In this paper, we propose an efficient weighted integrative clustering called intCC by combining ensemble method, consensus clustering and kernel learning integrative clustering. We illustrate that intCC can accurately uncover the latent cluster structures via extensive simulation studies and a case study on the TCGA pan cancer datasets. An R package intCC implementing our proposed method is available at https://github.com/candsj/intCC.",
