                "abstract": "Chromatin-associated non-coding RNAs play important roles in various cellular processes by targeting genomic loci. Two types of genome-wide NGS e xperiments e xist to detect suc h targets: 'one-to-al', whic h focuses on targets of a single RNA, and 'all-to-al', which captures targets of all RNAs in a sample. As with many NGS experiments, they are prone to biases and noise, so it becomes essential to detect 'peaks'-specific interactions of an RNA with genomic targets. Here, we present BaRDIC-Binomial RNA-DNA Interaction Caller-a tailored method to detect peaks in both types of RNA-DNA interaction data. BaRDIC is the first tool to simultaneously take into account the two most prominent biases in the data: chromatin heterogeneity and distance-dependent decay of interaction frequency. Since RNAs differ in their interaction preferences, B aRDIC adapts peak siz es according to the abundances and contact patterns of individual RNAs. These features enable B aRDIC to mak e more robust predictions than currently applied peak-calling algorithms and better handle the characteristic sparsity of all-to-all data.
