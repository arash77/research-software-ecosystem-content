                "abstract": "Background: MiRNAs are involved in the occurrence and development of many diseases. Extensive literature studies have demonstrated that miRNA-disease associations are stratified and encompass ~ 20% causal associations. Computational models that predict causal miRNA-disease associations provide effective guidance in identifying novel interpretations of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Although several predictive models for miRNA-disease associations exist, it is still challenging to discriminate causal miRNA-disease associations from non-causal ones. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop an efficient prediction model for causal miRNA-disease association prediction. Results: We developed DNI-MDCAP, an improved computational model that incorporated additional miRNA similarity metrics, deep graph embedding learning-based network imputation and semi-supervised learning framework. Through extensive predictive performance evaluation, including tenfold cross-validation and independent test, DNI-MDCAP showed excellent performance in identifying causal miRNA-disease associations, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.896 and 0.889, respectively. Regarding the challenge of discriminating causal miRNA-disease associations from non-causal ones, DNI-MDCAP exhibited superior predictive performance compared to existing models MDCAP and LE-MDCAP, reaching an AUROC of 0.870. Wilcoxon test also indicated significantly higher prediction scores for causal associations than for non-causal ones. Finally, the potential causal miRNA-disease associations predicted by DNI-MDCAP, exemplified by diabetic nephropathies and hsa-miR-193a, have been validated by recently published literature, further supporting the reliability of the prediction model. Conclusions: DNI-MDCAP is a dedicated tool to specifically distinguish causal miRNA-disease associations with substantially improved accuracy.
