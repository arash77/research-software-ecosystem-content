description: geneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by
  exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length
  gene bodies.  In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations
  beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to see peak summary statistics for
  the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., n-closest gene whilst ranking
  the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing the
  fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and downstream
  extensions on the original boundaries of each gene's coordinates.  Since different
  ChIP-seq peak callers produce different differentially enriched peaks with a large
  variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating peak lists
  with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process.  As such, the goal of geneXtendeR
  is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby
  aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective
  gene candidates during qPCR.
