                "abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent, abundant, and conserved internal modification in the eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNAs) and plays a crucial role in the cellular process. Although more than ten methods were developed for m6A detection over the past decades, there were rooms left to improve the predictive accuracy and the efficiency. In this paper, we proposed an improved method for predicting m6A modification sites, which was based on bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), called Deepm6A-MT. The Deepm6A-MT has two input channels. One is to use an embedding layer followed by the Bi-GRU and then by the CNN, and another is to use one-hot encoding, dinucleotide one-hot encoding, and nucleotide chemical property codes. We trained and evaluated the Deepm6A-MT both by the 5-fold cross-validation and the independent test. The empirical tests showed that the Deepm6A-MT achieved the state of the art performance. In addition, we also conducted the cross-species and the cross-tissues tests to further verify the Deepm6A-MT for effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, for the convenience of academic research, we deployed the Deepm6A-MT to the web server, which is accessed at the URL http://www.biolscience.cn/Deepm6A-MT/.",
