                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Comprehensive targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels are routinely used in modern molecular cancer diagnostics. In molecular tumor boards, the detected genomic alterations are often discussed to decide the next treatment options for patients with cancer. With the increasing size and complexity of NGS panels, the discussion of these results becomes increasingly complex, especially if they are reported in a text-based form, as it is the standard in current molecular pathology. METHODS: We have developed the Molecular Tumor Profiling pilot (MTPpilot) webservice using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL to support the clinical discussion of NGS results at molecular tumor boards. RESULTS: MTPpilot integrates various public genome, network, and cancer mutation databases with interactive visualization tools to assess the functional impact of mutations and support clinical decision making at tumor boards. CONCLUSION: MTPpilot is tailored for discussion of NGS gene panel results at molecular tumor boards. It is freely available as a webservice at MTPpilot.",
