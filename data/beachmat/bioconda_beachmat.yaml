description: Provides a consistent C++ class interface for reading from a variety
  of commonly used matrix types. Ordinary matrices and several sparse/dense Matrix
  classes are directly supported, along with a subset of the delayed operations implemented
  in the DelayedArray package. All other matrix-like objects are supported by calling
  back into R.
