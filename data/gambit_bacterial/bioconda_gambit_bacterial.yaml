description: 'GAMBIT (Genomic Approximation Method for Bacterial Identification and
  Tracking)

  is a tool for rapid taxonomic identification of microbial pathogens. It uses an

  extremely efficient genomic distance metric along with a curated database of

  approximately 50,000 reference genomes (derived from NCBI RefSeq) to identify

  unknown bacterial genomes within seconds.
