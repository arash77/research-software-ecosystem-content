                "abstract": "Rhinovirus (RV), a prominent causative agent of both upper and lower respiratory diseases, ranks among the most prevalent human respiratory viruses. RV infections are associated with various illnesses, including colds, asthma exacerbations, croup and pneumonia, imposing significant and extended societal burdens. Characterized by a high mutation rate and genomic diversity, RV displays a diverse serological landscape, encompassing a total of 174 serotypes identified to date. Understanding RV genetic diversity is crucial for epidemiological surveillance and investigation of respiratory diseases. This study introduces a comprehensive and high-quality RV data resource, designated RVdb (http://rvdb.mgc.ac.cn), covering 26 909 currently identified RV strains, along with RV-related sequences, 3D protein structures and publications. Furthermore, this resource features a suite of web-based utilities optimized for easy browsing and searching, as well as automatic sequence annotation, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), phylogenetic tree construction, RVdb BLAST and a serotyping pipeline. Equipped with a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, RVdb provides a convenient and powerful platform on which to analyse the genetic characteristics of RVs. Additionally, RVdb also supports the efforts of virologists and epidemiologists to monitor and trace both existing and emerging RV-related infectious conditions in a public health context.",
