    "description": "The Plant Metabolome Hub (PMhub), available at https: pmhub.org.cn, is a valuable resource designed to provide scientists with comprehensive information on plant metabolites. It offers extensive details about their reference spectra, genetic foundations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways and biological functions. The PMhub contains chemical data for 188 837 plant metabolites gathered from various sources, with 1 467 041 standard in-silico high-resolution tandem mass-spectrometry (HRMS MS) spectra corresponding to these metabolites. Beyond its extensive literature-derived data, PMhub also boasts a sizable collection of experimental metabolites; it contains 144 366 detected features in 10 typical plant species, with 16 423 successfully annotated by using standard in-silico HRMS MS data, this collection is further supplemented with thousands of features gathered from reference metabolites",

The PMhub contains chemical data for 188 837 plant metabolites gathered from various sources, with 1 467 041 standard / in-silico high-resolution tandem mass-spectrometry (HRMS / MS) spectra corresponding to these metabolites.

For each metabolite, the PMhub enables the reconstructed of a simulated network based on str uct ural similarities and existing metabolic pathways. Unlike previous plant-specific metabolome databases, PMhub not only contains a vast amount of metabolic data but also assembles the corresponding genomic and / or transcriptomic information, incorporating multiple methods for the comprehensive genetic analysis of metabolites. To validate the practicality, we verified a synthetic pathw a y f or N - p -coumaro yltyramine b y in vitro enzymatic activity experiments. In summary, the robust functionality provided by the PMhub will make it an indispensable tool for studying plant metabolomics.",
