                "abstract": "Distinct from the traditional diagnostic/prognostic biomarker (adopted as the indicator of disease state/process), the therapeutic biomarker (ThMAR) has emerged to be very crucial in the clinical development and clinical practice of all therapies. There are five types of ThMAR that have been found to play indispensable roles in various stages of drug discovery, such as: Pharmacodynamic Biomarker essential for guaranteeing the pharmacological effects of a therapy, Safety Biomarker critical for assessing the extent or likelihood of therapy-induced toxicity, Monitoring Biomarker indispensable for guiding clinical management by serially measuring patients’ status, Predictive Biomarker crucial for maximizing the clinical outcome of a therapy for specific individuals, and Surrogate Endpoint fundamental for accelerating the approval of a therapy. However, these data of ThMARs has not been comprehensively described by any of the existing databases. Herein, a database, named ‘TheMarker’, was therefore constructed to (a) systematically offer all five types of ThMAR used at different stages of drug development, (b) comprehensively describe ThMAR information for the largest number of drugs among available databases, (c) extensively cover the widest disease classes by not just focusing on anticancer therapies. These data in TheMarker are expected to have great implication and significant impact on drug discovery and clinical practice, and it is freely accessible without any login requirement at: https://idrblab.org/themarker.",
